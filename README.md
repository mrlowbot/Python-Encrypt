# Python Encrypt

## Introduction

This code implements a simple encryption and decryption program using the AES algorithm and the PyCrypto library. The user can choose to either encrypt a plaintext message or decrypt a ciphertext message.

## Implementation

The code uses the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm, a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm, in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode. A 32-byte random key is generated using the `os.urandom` function, which generates cryptographically secure random data.

The encryption process starts by padding the plaintext to the block size of AES (16 bytes) using the `pad` function. The `encrypt` function then creates a new AES object with the key and CBC mode, encrypts the padded plaintext, and returns the base64-encoded ciphertext.

The decryption process uses the `decrypt` function to create a new AES object with the key and CBC mode, decrypts the base64-decoded ciphertext, and unpads the decrypted message using the `unpad` function. The decrypted message is returned as a string after stripping any trailing null bytes.

## Conclusion

This code provides a basic implementation of AES encryption and decryption in Python, but it is important to note that it is not secure for use in real-world applications. There are several security considerations to be aware of when using AES encryption, such as key management and the use of a secure padding scheme. This code is meant to be used as a starting point for understanding AES encryption, and should not be used in a production environment.
